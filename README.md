# ActivityLogger

A DIY keystroke/mouse movement logger in Java so i know when i have been active so i can declare my hours honestly.

DIY to minimize the risk of having information stolen.

It outputs an activity.txt which contains the amount of keystrokes/mouse movements per 5 minutes.

Note that keystrokes/mouse moves is not 1-on-1 equal to having worked. One could have been on top of the Kim Jung Un mountain thinking a bit about what should be done next which is also work.
